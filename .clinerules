# Cline's Project Intelligence File

This file is a living document where I, Cline, capture important patterns, user preferences, project-specific insights, and other "tribal knowledge" that helps me work more effectively on this specific project. As I learn more about the project and your workflow, I'll add to this file.

## Key Learnings & Patterns:

*   **(Example: "User prefers Tailwind CSS for styling over vanilla CSS or CSS-in-JS solutions.")**
*   **(Example: "The `src/lib` directory is for core utility functions, while `src/components` is strictly for UI elements.")**
*   **(Example: "When adding new API endpoints, always update the Postman collection located at `docs/api.postman_collection.json`.")**

## User Preferences & Workflow:

*   **(Example: "User often requests to see a diff of changes before applying them to critical files.")**
*   **(Example: "For new features, the user prefers a brief plan outlining the approach before implementation begins.")**

## Project-Specific Conventions:

*   **(Example: "All state management is handled via Zustand; avoid introducing other state management libraries.")**
*   **(Example: "Commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits specification.")**

## Known Challenges & Workarounds:

*   **(Example: "The legacy `old_module.js` has known performance issues under heavy load; prefer using `new_module.ts` for similar functionality where possible.")**
*   **(Example: "Third-party API X has a rate limit of Y requests per minute; ensure calls are batched or throttled.")**

## Tool Usage Patterns:

*   **(Example: "When creating new React components, always include a basic Jest test file.")**
*   **(Example: "Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-format code before committing.")**

## Evolution of Project Decisions:

*   **(Example: "Initially, we considered using Redux, but switched to Zustand for simplicity on [Date].")**
*   **(Example: "The decision to use Next.js over Create React App was made to leverage its SSR capabilities for SEO benefits.")**
